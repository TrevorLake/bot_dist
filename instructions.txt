1. Install Python, if you have not
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install dependencies, if you have not
    - Hit window key and open up command prompt
    - Run:
        pip install pyautogui
        pip install opencv-python

3. Set config file (config.json)
    - as of 8/21/2023 the only implemented items are: 
        - Pox
        - Adrenaline

4. In game:
    - Filter by the item and set the max price
    - Make sure you select 'Remember selected filter'
    - Leave at least 1 row open at the top of stash. 3 or 4 if possible.
        - If you are running out of space before rubles, this isn't necessary

5. Double click the 'run_bot.py' file to run the bot 
    - The file explorer needs to not be full screen
        - The 'TRADER' and 'FLEA MARKET' buttons need to be visable
    - Double click the 'sell.py' file to sell without running bot

6. Don't fuck around with the code. Timers are the way they are
    for a reason, and I have been temperarily banned from the flea once
    for making it too fast. I can help add more items just lmk.
